                    <p className='Summary'>Gene motifs are short regions in genomes that have very specific and well-defined biological functions. Most motifs are DNA or RNA regulatory regions that can act as transcription factors or protein binding sites. These sites influence the result of transcription and translation based on what protein and what time the protein binds to the site. Being able to find motifs can be very difficult among a sea of letters that make up nucleotide sequences, yet is required for understanding the full capability of a living organism's genome.</p>
